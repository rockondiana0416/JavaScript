                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>React is a light that turns on your javaScript to make it bigger, better, brighter, and bolder. It is an open source library that is easy to learn and use, easy to maintain, and easy to debug. React is a library of code made of components. The components are like the books at you local library. You don't have to use the whole thing like you would a framework. Being that it is a library, pieces of code called snipits can be used. Using snipits in your site will make it faster and makes for a great user experience.</p>
                
                <p>React has an extension called JSX that creates a virtual DOM that can be manipulated using HTML code. By doing that, it can render code concurrently. Concurrently meaning, it can pause other code to make high priority code update first. This all makes your seach boxes, buttons, input boxes, and menus super fast. Reading this article from <a href="https://skillcrush.com/2019/05/14/what-is-react-js/" target="_blank">Skillcrush.com</a> really helped me to understand how it all works together.</p>

                <h3>Learn React</h3>

                    <p>Let's talk about where to learn React. A good place to start is the React homepage. There is an intro to React <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank">Tutorial</a>. It walks you through the steps to create a tic tac toe game by giving you starter code and you can create it with just a little HTML and JavaScript knowledge.</p> 
                
                <p>There are some great resources to learn React for free? Check out this website. It has the 10+ best <a href="https://designrevision.com/best-free-react-tutorials-courses/" target="_blank">Free React</a> tutorials and courses for 2019. Created by Catalin Vasile in March 2019. So it's pretty up to date.</p>
                
                <p>The<a href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/learning-react-roadmap-from-scratch-to-advanced-bff7735531b6" target="_blank"> Roadmap to Learning React</a> written by Srebalaji Thirumalai is a great article to read. He explains how to get set up, react routers, webpacks, and server rendering. </p>

                <h3>React Community</h3>
                    <p>There is a ton of support for the React community. Again just head over to reactjs.org and find their <a href="https://reactjs.org/community/support.html" target="_blank">Community Section</a>. There are community forums, discussions, chats and news. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/react" target="_blank">Hackermoon</a> has a large selection of articles and tutorials on how to use and implement React code. Because React code is open source, it can be shared and reshared by anyone.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are even conferences for just all things React. <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/react-conf-an-energetic-reactive-community/" target="_blank">React Conference 2019</a> With over 600 attendees this past year. There were keynote speakers and many workshops for developers to learn. The conference was deemed a success.  </p>

                <h3>Examples and Favorites</h3>
                <p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook.com</a>. Facebook was coded using React.js. The creator of React Jordan Walke, an engineer at Facebook, wanted to improve the UI of the site. So in 2011 it was released to the public as open source and free. React creates a better user experience by using components of code. Components are the small snipits of code that can be injected into your html. </p>
            
                <p>Because react is used on big name websites like <a href="https://www.stimulusco.com/blog/top-10-sites-built-with-reactjs" target="_blank">Air BNB, BBC, Dropbox, Flipboard, and Netflix</a>. Clients and employers feel confident in developers that know react.</p>
